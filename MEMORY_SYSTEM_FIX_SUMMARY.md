# Memory System Fix Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Duplicate Memory Saves
- **Problem**: Multiple memory saves were happening for the same session
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `sessionSavedRef` to track if a session has already been saved
  - Check this flag before saving to prevent duplicates
  - Reset the flag when new user activity is detected

### 2. Incorrect Message Counting
- **Problem**: Messages were being counted incorrectly, showing inflated totals
- **Solutions**:
  - Filter out optimistic messages and welcome messages from counts
  - Only count unique messages using a Map with composite keys
  - Track only user messages for activity detection (not assistant responses)
  - Update database to only count user messages in total_messages field

### 3. Better Activity Tracking
- **Problem**: System wasn't accurately tracking user activity vs assistant responses
- **Solutions**:
  - Added `lastUserMessageTimeRef` to specifically track user activity
  - Only reset inactivity timer on new user messages
  - Use user activity time (not general activity) for save decisions

### 4. Server-Side Duplicate Prevention
- **Problem**: Even with client-side checks, duplicates could still occur
- **Solution**: 
  - Added server-side check for recent saves (within 15 minutes)
  - Compare message counts to detect likely duplicates
  - Return existing memory if duplicate detected

## Technical Changes

### Client-Side (Chat.tsx)
1. Added new refs:
   - `sessionSavedRef`: Boolean to track if session already saved
   - `lastUserMessageTimeRef`: Timestamp of last user message

2. Updated `saveConversationMemory`:
   - Check `sessionSavedRef` before saving
   - Set flag to true after successful save

3. Updated message tracking:
   - Filter out optimistic and welcome messages
   - Use Map to ensure unique messages
   - Only count user messages for activity

4. Updated `resetInactivityTimer`:
   - Only set timer if session not already saved

5. Updated cleanup effect:
   - Check `sessionSavedRef` before saving on unmount
   - Use `lastUserMessageTimeRef` for activity timing

### Server-Side (memory/route.ts)
1. Added duplicate detection:
   - Query for recent saves (last 15 minutes)
   - Compare message counts
   - Return existing memory if duplicate

2. Fixed message counting:
   - Only count user messages in total_messages field
   - More accurate representation of student activity

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test normal conversation flow:
   - Send several messages back and forth
   - Wait 10 minutes for auto-save
   - Verify only one memory record created

2. Test navigation scenarios:
   - Send messages, then navigate away quickly
   - Return and send more messages
   - Verify no duplicate saves

3. Test edge cases:
   - Very short conversations (< 4 messages)
   - Conversations with only user messages
   - Multiple tabs open with same chat

## Notes

- Memory saves happen after 10 minutes of inactivity OR 2 minutes after unmount
- Minimum 4 messages required for a save
- Only user/assistant messages are counted (not system messages)
- Duplicate prevention works both client-side and server-side
