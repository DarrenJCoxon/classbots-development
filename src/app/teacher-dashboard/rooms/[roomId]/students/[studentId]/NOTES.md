# Student Details Page Developer Notes

## Magic Link Implementation

The magic link functionality in this page has been implemented directly in the React component rather than through API endpoints due to routing issues experienced with the Next.js API routes.

### Initial Approach

We initially tried creating several API endpoints:
- `/api/teacher/students/magic-link`
- `/api/magic-link-gen`
- `/api/teacher/link`
- `/api/test`

All these routes consistently returned 404 errors when deployed, despite having proper file structure.

### Current Solution

The current solution:
1. Generates magic links directly in the front-end component
2. Uses the format: `roomCode_userId_encodedStudentName`
3. Uses the student name from the profile data
4. Creates the magic link URL with the proper origin
5. Includes copy-to-clipboard and regeneration functionality

### Room Code Implementation

To ensure magic links are generated with the correct room code:
1. The component fetches the actual room code from `/api/teacher/room-details?roomId={roomId}`
2. If this fails, it falls back to using the first 6 characters of the room UUID
3. The actual room code is important for the magic link to work correctly with the existing system

### Magic Link Format

Magic links follow this format:
```
{BASE_URL}/m/{roomCode}_{userId}_{encodedStudentName}
```

This maintains compatibility with the existing magic link processing page at `/m/[code]/page.tsx`.

### Future Improvements

If you're revisiting this code:
1. Check if the API routing issues have been resolved
2. Consider creating a proper API endpoint for magic link generation and validation
3. Store magic links in the database for better tracking
4. Add better error handling if the room code cannot be retrieved

For reference, the magic link code is in the `generateMagicLink` function in the `page.tsx` file.
